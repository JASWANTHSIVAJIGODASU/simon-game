# Simon Game

This repository contains the files for a Simon game implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## File Descriptions

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the game interface.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the game interface.
- `game.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic (to be created and added to the repository).

## Project Overview

The Simon game is a simple memory game where players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. The game gets progressively harder as the sequence length increases.

## Files

### index.html

The HTML file structures the game interface, including the title and the color buttons.

### styles.css

The CSS file styles the game interface, defining the appearance of the game buttons, the title, and the game over state.

### game.js

The JavaScript file (to be created) will contain the logic for the Simon game, including generating sequences, handling user input, and managing game state.
